# interview-app
An open-book, take-home programming project for SoftDev applicants.

## How to use this application as a part of the interview process:
To include this project in your application materials, you simply need to make sure that you are able to access it 
and run it in Visual Studio's Debug mode at the time of your interview. This may be done either on a machine that 
you will bring to your interview or on an internet-connected workstation that we will provide. 

Please refer to [github's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for assistance 
acquiring your own copy of the project.

## How to use this application during the code editing process:
interview-app emulates an unfinished data analyzer tool. The finished version of the program will read a .csv file 
and perform some logic on the data inside (see "data.csv" at the root of the project). To learn more about how 
interview-app should function, read the source code carefully, paying close attention to the `TODO:` comments and 
`<summary>` blocks.

Please complete the application to the best of your abilities and be prepared to show us your work during your 
interview.

## FAQs

**"I've never used C# before; what tools should I use to tackle this project?"**

We highly recommend that you use Visual Studio 2012 or later to work on this project. However, you may work with any 
tool set you like as long as you are able to demonstrate your version of interview-app during your interview.

**"Visual Studio is a pretty heavy-duty IDE with a lot of features to learn; can you help me get set up?"**

We definitely don't mind helping to get you to get started using Visual Studio. If you're having specific installation or
environment problems, please let us know what they are as soon as possible so we can get them resolved before your 
interview.

**"Do I have to do this project as a part of the interview?"**

Nope! This portion is completely optional. However, we strongly recommend that you at least attempt it because it is 
an excellent opportunity to set yourself apart from other candidates.
